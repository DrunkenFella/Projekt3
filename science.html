    <h1 class="title">Global warming</h1>

    <h2 class="story">Conspiracy theorists allege that global warming science has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons. Prominent individuals who have supported this theory include former US President Donald Trump, US Senator James Inhofe, British journalist Christopher Booker, and Viscount Christopher Monckton.</h2>

    <h1 class="title">Weather and earthquake control projects</h1>

    <h2 class="story">Conspiracy theorists have proposed various theories regarding weather control projects, including the assertion that HAARP, a US government-funded radio-technology research program, is a secret weather-controlling system that caused natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and earthquakes like the Haiti and Tohoku earthquakes. HAARP has also been linked to mind-control technology. Cloud-seeding technologies have also been of interest to conspiracy theorists, with claims that they caused the 1952 Lynmouth Flood in Devon, England (debunked), and the 2010 Pakistan floods.</h2>
