    <h2>Air travel and aircraft have spawned numerous conspiracy theories, including incidents like the Kashmir Princess bombing in 1955, Pan Am Flight 103 bombing in 1988, and Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash in 1994, along with alleged sightings and technology theories.</h2>

            The black helicopter conspiracy theory emerged in the 1960s and was promoted by the John Birch Society in the US, who believed a UN force would arrive in black helicopters to control the US. A similar theory surfaced in the UK in the 1970s. The theory gained momentum in the 1990s under Bill Clinton's presidency and was promoted in Jim Keith's book Black Helicopters Over America. By the 2000s, the term "black helicopters" was used as a shorthand for far-fetched anti-government conspiracy theories, embraced by militia groups and some guests on Glenn Beck's talk show.

    <h1 class="title">Chemtrails</h1>
    <h2 class="stroy">The theory of chemtrails, also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), claims that the condensation trails or "contrails" left by aircraft contain harmful chemicals and biological agents, such as aluminum, strontium, and barium. It is believed by about 17% of people worldwide. However, a 2016 study by the Carnegie Institution for Science, involving 77 atmospheric chemists and geochemists, found no evidence to support the theory, with 76 of them reporting that chemtrail theorists rely on poor sampling or have no supporting evidence.</h2>
