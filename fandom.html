    <h2>Shipping, a desire for two celebrities to be in a romantic relationship, is often accompanied by conspiracy theories that claim pregnancies and children of partnered or married celebrity couples are fake. Some who ship two celebrities of the same gender claim they are supporting LGBT by backing two people who are closeted by a homophobic industry. Women tend to dominate conspiracy communities around celebrity relationships.</h2>
