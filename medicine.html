    <h1 class="title">Alternative therapy suppression</h1>

    <h2 class="story">A 2013 University of Chicago study found that nearly 50% of Americans believe in at least one medical conspiracy theory. One popular theory among 37% of those surveyed is that the Food and Drug Administration suppresses natural cures due to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. Fraudster Kevin Trudeau has been a prominent advocate of similar conspiracy theories.</h2>

    <h1 class="title">Artificial diseases</h1>

    <h2 class="story">HIV was transmitted from monkeys to humans in the 1930s. However, the KGB spread a conspiracy theory in the 1980s that the CIA invented it. This theory has been promoted by individuals such as Steven Seagal, Louis Farrakhan, and Thabo Mbeki. The Washington Times published articles in January 2020 claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was part of a Chinese biological weapons program. Other conspiracy theories allege that pharmaceutical companies create conditions and diseases such as ADHD, HSV, and HPV.</h2>
