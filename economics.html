    <h1 class="title">Predictive programming</h1>

    <h2 class="story">Some theorists claim that fictional media is used for "predictive programming," where it is manipulated to reference planned events, such as false flags or social changes. This is believed to condition and brainwash the public to accept these events more easily. Predictive programming has been linked to events such as 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic and has been connected to media like Die Hard, The Simpsons, and Contagion.</h2>
