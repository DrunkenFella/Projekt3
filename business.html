    <h2 class="story">Several conspiracy theories surround the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil-rig accident, suggesting that it was caused by sabotage from individuals promoting environmentalism, or a submarine strike by North Korea or Russia.

However, Coca-Cola President Donald Keough denied the accusation, stating that the company was neither foolish nor clever enough to do so.</h2>
