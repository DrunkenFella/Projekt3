    <h2> Conspiracy theories abound about space programs, including claims that the US Moon landings were faked, the Soviet government covered up evidence of failed space flights, and a secret program of UN-manned space fleets exists. Another theory claims that NASA is hiding the existence of a planet called Nibiru or Planet X that is set to destroy the Earth, with predictions for the date of destruction including 2003, 2012, and 2017.</h2>

    <h1 class="title">Extraterrestrials and UFOs</h1>

    <h2 class="story">Conspiracy theories about alien life often involve alleged government cover-ups of incidents such as the Roswell UFO incident and activity at Area 51. The phenomenon of dead cattle with missing body parts and drained of blood has also spawned theories about aliens and secret government experiments. Ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin inspired many conspiracy theories, including one proposing that the Anunnaki from Sumerian mythology were extraterrestrial beings who came to Earth to mine gold. British conspiracy theorist David Icke adapted and elaborated on this theory, claiming that the Bush family, Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, and the British Royal Family were or are blood-drinking, shape-shifting alien reptiles.</h2>
