    <h1 class="title">Rigged selection processes</h1>

    <h2 class="story">According to the "frozen envelope theory", the 1985 NBA draft lottery was rigged in favor of the New York Knicks so they could select Patrick Ewing.

In a similar vein, Scottish football manager David Moyes has proposed the "hot balls theory", which suggests that certain balls used in UEFA draws have been warmed to produce predetermined outcomes.</h2>

    <h1 class="title">1984 Firecracker 400</h1>

    <h2 class="story">Conspiracy theorists claim that the 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway was fixed to provide good publicity for the event. The race was attended by sitting US president Ronald Reagan and marked driver Richard Petty's 200th and final career victory. They allege that rival driver Cale Yarborough's premature retirement to the pit road was staged.</h2>
